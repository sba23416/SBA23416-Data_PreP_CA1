    "Introduction: My assignment i have been asked by Haulage company to analyse a dataset based on data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The dataset’s positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS\n",
    "\n",
    "*The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.\n",

    "*The main aim of this analysis will help determine the investment strategy for the company in the upcoming year.\n",

PCA is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction algorithm, but it can also be useful as a tool for visualization, for noise filtering,\n",
